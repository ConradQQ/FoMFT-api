# FoMFT-api

FoMFT-api is a lightweight REST API that exposes structured data for the Empire Rising ecosystem. It provides clean endpoints for querying raw materials, colonies, armor, production components, and consumables. The service is built with Node.js/Express on MySQL (via mysql2/promise), deployed with an AWS RDS backend for reliable cloud-hosted data storage, uses CORS for safe cross-origin access, and ships with Jest + Supertest for request-level test coverage.
